### Current System Overview

- **Features:**
  - Modular component structure (`src/components/`, `src/pages/`, etc.).
  - Responsive layouts with navigation (Navbar, Sidebar).
  - Theming support (e.g., `ThemeContext`).
  - User authentication UI (LoginPage, Dashboard).
  - Admin and Farmer dashboards with analytics, history, and settings pages.
  - Utility hooks and context for state management and UI feedback (e.g., toast notifications).
  - Clean separation of UI, logic, and API service layers.

#### 2. **Backend**
- **Framework:** Django (Python) with Django REST Framework.
- **Features:**
  - Modular app structure (`backend/api/`).
  - User authentication and admin management.
  - Database migrations and schema management.
  - Media handling for scan uploads (e.g., `media/scans/`).
  - Integration points for machine learning (see below).
  - RESTful API endpoints for frontend consumption.

#### 3. **Machine Learning Integration**
- **Structure in Place:**
  - `ml/banana_detection/` and `ml/yield_prediction/` directories with inference scripts and integration guides.
  - Placeholder for model files and integration documentation.
  - Ready for future integration with Roboflow and YOLOv8 for image-based detection and prediction.

#### 4. **Project Management**
- **Documentation:**
  - `README.md` for project overview.
  - `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` for database structure.
  - `FRONTEND_DATA_FLOW.md` for frontend logic and data movement.
  - `INTEGRATION_LOGIC.md` for backend-ML integration steps.
  - `PROJECT_NEXT_STEPS.md` for ongoing planning.
