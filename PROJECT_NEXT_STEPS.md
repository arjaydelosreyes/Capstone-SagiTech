# Project Next Steps

Here are the recommended next steps for your Django + React Banana Farming Analytics project:

---

## 1. Full End-to-End Testing
- Test the entire flow: login, scan upload, scan history, session expiry, and logout.
- Try edge cases: expired tokens, invalid logins, uploading large images, etc.

## 2. Polish the User Experience
- Add loading spinners or skeletons for slow API calls.
- Add error messages for failed uploads or fetches.
- Optionally, add a user profile page for editing account info.

## 3. Analytics and Dashboard
- Enhance the analytics/dashboard pages to use backend data for all stats and charts.
- Add more visualizations or insights as needed.

## 4. Security and Production Readiness
- Set up HTTPS for production.
- Configure CORS and allowed hosts.
- Set secure cookie and session settings.
- (Optional) Add rate limiting or monitoring.

## 5. Prepare for ML Integration
- When your ML model is ready, update the backend inference logic.
- Connect the scan upload to real ML predictions.

## 6. Documentation
- Document your API endpoints, data models, and frontend integration for your team.
